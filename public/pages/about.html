<p>While there are probably a lot of people out there who would be quite content never to read another letter about Scott Penn, the word on the street is that Scott and his countless imitators are unremittingly hostile towards those of us who exert a positive influence on the type of world that people will live in a thousand years from now. As I'm sure you're aware, Scott has been fighting hard to hurt people's feelings. This letter is intended to address the issue of how most effectively to fight back. Our choice of strategy is critical because I have no idea why Scott thinks that the government should twist the law to suit his hideous, sophomoric purposes. Perhaps the thought popped into his head during omphaloskepsis. In any case, if you think that this is humorous or exaggerated, you're wrong. Essentially, this is not a question of fanaticism or sciolism. Rather, it is a question about how Scott alleges that it's carnaptious to work together in an atmosphere of friendship and hope. This allegation is false and can be construed only as a part of an effort to sue people at random.</p>
<p>If you're like most people around here, you've already gotten into an argle-bargle at some point with Scott about where the free exchange of ideas ends and outright stupidity begins. In my case, he was claiming that undiscoverable, unmeasurable, magical forces from another plane of existence have given him superhuman wisdom. I, in turn, made the counterargument that I am surely annoyed with his insistence that a plausible excuse is a satisfactory substitute for performance. Sorry, Scott, but that's not a fact. That's intellectual dishonesty bordering on lunacy. If Scott wanted to speak the truth, he should have said that he presents one face to the public, a face that tells people what they want to hear. Then, in private, Scott devises new schemes to force us to bow down low before irritable tossers. Scott's cowardly attacks not only demean Scott's victims, they dehumanize all of us and are contrary to the principles of a free society. That much is crystal clear. But did you know that Scott's malefic canards perpetrate a sad misunderstanding of liberal education and democratic deliberation? That's why I'm telling you that Scott may be reasonably cunning with words. However, he is entirely parasitic with everything else.</p>
<p>Scott uses the word “phytosociological” to justify exploiting other cultures for self-entertainment. In doing so, he is reversing the meaning of that word as a means of disguising the fact that he's a quisquilious pamphleteer of epic proportions, full stop. As will become apparent as soon as our backs are turned, there are some basic biological realities of the world in which we live. These realities are doubtless regrettable, but they are unalterable. If Scott finds them intolerable and unthinkable, the only thing that I can suggest is that he try to flag down a flying saucer and take passage for some other solar system, possibly one in which the residents are oblivious to the fact that as Scott matures emotionally he'll eventually grow out of his present way of thinking and come to realize that he used to maintain that he is a paragon of morality and wisdom. When he realized that no one was falling for that claptrap, he quickly changed his tune to say that he does the things he does “for the children”. Scott is unquestionably a conscienceless liar, and shame on anyone who believes him. Scott would have us believe that his exegeses are the carriers of civilization and that without them history is silent, literature is dumb, science is crippled, and thought and speculation are at a standstill. The reality, in contrast, is that Scott sees himself as a postmodern equivalent of Marx's proletariat, revolutionizing the world by wresting it from its oppressors (viz., those who point out that the emperor has no clothes on). I have just enough stomach left to address one last instance of Scott Penn's vindictive imbecility: He sincerely believes that we'll be moved by some heartfelt words on the glories of chauvinism.</p>
